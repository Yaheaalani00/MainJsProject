# RPS Game


RPS Game is a website where you can play rock, paper scissors against a computer which chooses random options. This site will be targeted towards people who likes to play some games with a lot of javascript code. 

## Features 

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so. You will need to explain what value each of the features provides for the user, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

We have a scoreboard to keep track on your wins and losses. You have 3 options to pick from (Rock, Paper and scissors). You can see the rules at the bottom of the site.

### Existing Features


- __The Game Area__

  - This section will allow the user to play the RPS game. You will be able to easily see the icons which you can choose from. 


- __The Score Area__

  - This section will allow the user to see exactly how many wins and losses  they have. 




## Testing 

I have went through a lot of testing to make sure the user will have an enjoyable time without any bugs. The website is fully responsive to all type of screens.
On phones the choices between rock, paper and scissors will be above eachother not in line with eachoter but the rest of the game is as it is on big screen.
